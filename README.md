# AirBnB_clone

This project is the first step towards building our first full web application: the AirBnB clone. This first step is very important because we will use what we build during this project with all other following projects: HTML/CSS templating, database storage, API, front-end integration...

### Command Intepreter
A <strong>command interpreter</strong> would be created in this project to manage the objects of our project:
- Create a new object (ex: a new User or a new Place)
- Retrieve an object from a file, a database etc...
- Do operations on objects (count, compute stats, etc...)
- Update attributes of an object
- Destroy an object
